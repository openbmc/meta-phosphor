As a replacement for channel 15, selected whether or not SSIF is enabled as an image feature.\n2. In the platform-specific version of this file.\n\nAs written, this will enable SSIF channels on systems that don\u0027t have an SSIF capable processor, which is an issue.\n\nIdeally we also wouldn\u0027t be enabling KCS on platforms that don\u0027t support it either, but unfortunately that\u0027s what we have today.",
