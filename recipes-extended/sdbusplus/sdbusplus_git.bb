# sdbus++ has a handful of runtime dependencies on other python packages.
# Bitbake doesn't do anything with RDEPENDS in native context because
# native context doesn't have packages.
#
# While technically sdbus++ doesn't require its runtime dependencies to be
# installed to build, work around the above native context behavior
# by adding a build dependency so that clients don't have to DEPEND
# on sdbus++ runtime dependencies manually.
