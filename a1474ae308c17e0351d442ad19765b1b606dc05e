My reason was that we have no other place where we ensure we compile any of the boost::asio code with the latest Yocto version of boost and I wanted to be able to catch issues there as close to the source as possible.  When I was upgrading a few other repositories to sdbusplus-as-meson, I ran into incompatibilities between sdbusplus and boost versions.\n\nIn order to make boost useful we would also need to keep `-Dexamples\u003denabled`.",
