      "message": "Why would you want to make your known integrated filesytem a module?\n\nUsing modules in an embedded environment where the hardware and file system requirements are well known only increases resource utilization, from the overhead of module referencs, to file system overhead, but also each module has multiple sections rounded up to page alignment or greater.\n\nYocto builds a custom image for the system being targeted.  I understand some what to support multiple related systems, but how many need to support different BMC storage in one build?",
