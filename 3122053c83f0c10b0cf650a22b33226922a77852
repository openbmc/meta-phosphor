      "message": "Joseph, can you tell me the size difference. Still prefer the pam_pwquality as strength checking against dictionary of words is done only in pam_pwquality. pam_cracklib already supported this and moving to pam_paswdqc will be degrading the security check which we enforced earlier.\nSo it\u0027s better to replace the same with pam_pwquality (which is also compatible with pam_cracklib), such that when we update from old version to new version, we need to make sure that pam_cracklib module name in pam.d configuration files is replaced with pam_pwquality. \nBy the way, i don\u0027t find a patch for upgrade mechanism, not sure, whether it is not sent for review. If it is not created, let me know, i can try to send it out, with my local testing of these changes, such that all these are updated and bumped up together.",
