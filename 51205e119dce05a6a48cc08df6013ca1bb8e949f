Every daemon that needs PLDM shouldn\u0027t require a dependency on libpldm, similar to how IPMI or redfish are implemented.\n\n\u003e I will discuss with @Vishwa whether this feature can be put into the *.bbappend file.\n\nPlease don\u0027t do this, please architect your dependencies properly, and isolate the complexity of pldm in the pldm daemon, similar to how we do other things with other similar requirements.",
