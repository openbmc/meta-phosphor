The SDK doesn\u0027t have any such thing as RDEPENDS and so dependencies only get installed if they are DEPENDS.\n\nI looked at the version of sdbusplus_git.bb that was in the 2.6 tag and it has this wording:\n\n# sdbus++ has a handful of runtime dependencies on other python packages.\n# Bitbake doesn\u0027t do anything with RDEPENDS in native context because\n# native context doesn\u0027t have packages.\n#\n# While technically sdbus++ doesn\u0027t require its runtime dependencies to be\n# installed to build, work around the above native context behavior\n# by adding a build dependency so that clients don\u0027t have to DEPEND\n# on sdbus++ runtime dependencies manually.\n\nDEPENDS_append_class-native \u003d \" \\\n        python-inflection-native \\\n        python-mako-native \\\n        python-pyyaml-native \\\n        \"",
