      "message": "\u003e As per earlier discussion, this increases the image size\n\nI expect there are exactly zero people that would be upset by the modest size increase here, considering what you get in return.  So I still don\u0027t understand the rationale for making this configurable.  If you can find someone that doesn\u0027t want privilege separation on their OpenBMC based BMC I\u0027ll quit asking about it but I don\u0027t think there are any...\n\n\u003e and might be a problem for witherspoon targets.\n\nThis patch was automatically tested on a witherspoon:\n\n\u003e Build Successful                                                                                               \n\u003e IBM Hardware CI : witherspoon hardware tests passed         \n\nThese lines mean there weren\u0027t any problems with it.\n\n\u003e the privilege separation should be enabled platform-by-platform\n\nIn light of what I\u0027ve said above, do you still feel this way?
